            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Account Information</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              When you create an account, we collect your email address and password. Accounts are managed through Supabase, a secure authentication provider. We do not store your password directly — it is handled by Supabase's authentication infrastructure.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Organization Information</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Rescue organizations provide information including organization name, description, location, website, logo, and contact details. This information is displayed publicly on your rescue showcase page to help adopters find and connect with your organization.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Pet Information</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              You may upload pet photos, names, breeds, ages, species, descriptions, and other details about animals available for adoption. Pet photos are used to generate AI-powered artistic portraits.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Payment Information</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              Payment processing is handled by Stripe. We do not store your credit card numbers or bank account details. Stripe collects and processes payment information in accordance with their own{" "}

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Social Media Integrations</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
              If you connect your Instagram account, we store an access token, your Instagram user ID, and username. This data is used solely to post pet portraits to your Instagram account on your behalf. You can disconnect your Instagram at any time from your Settings page, which immediately deletes all stored Instagram credentials.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Automatically Collected Information</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              We may collect standard web server logs including IP addresses, browser type, referring pages, and timestamps. This data is used for security monitoring and service improvement. We do not use tracking cookies for advertising purposes.
